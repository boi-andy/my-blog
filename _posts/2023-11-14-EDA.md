This EDA will give more information on the following questions:

1. What causes a planet in the Star Wars' Galaxy to have a large population?
2. How do the sizes of the planets compare?
3. What does the distrubution of planet size look like?
4. Does the diameter of a planet correlate to the population of the planet?

## Comparison of Planet Size

Each planet has a different size diameter. Here we see a simple bar chart of the diameter of each planet in kilometers. Let's make this a little more interesting by making them circles with color.

This image compares the diameter size of each planet in kilometers. Bespin is the only gas planet, making it the largest planet by far. Other planets like Endor and Mustafar are amongst the smallest planets. 

## Distribution of Planet Diameters

These are the basic statistics for the diameter: <br>
count        38.00 <br>
mean      14344.39 <br>
std       17574.59<br>
min        4200.00<br>
25%       10096.00<br>
50%       12135.00<br>
75%       13497.50<br>
max      118000.000<br>

Bespin, the largest planet is skewing the data dramatically, increaing the mean. Let's run another analysis without the outlier.

## Distribution of Planet Diameters (Excluding Outlier)

Basic Statistics for Diameter (Excluding Outlier): <br>
count       37.00<br>
mean     11542.89<br>
std       3304.76<br>
min       4200.00<br>
25%      10088.00<br>
50%      12120.00<br>
75%      13490.00<br>
max      19720.00<br>

Without the planet Bespin, the distribution of the planets are much more normal. The standard deviation decresed almost 14,000 km and the mean decreased more than 3,000 km. We can seee that the average planet is about 11,500 km in diameter. The Death Star is able to destroy Alderan which is 12,500 km, meaning many of the planets in the Star Wars galaxy are in great danger so long as the Death Star is functional. 


## Population vs Diameter

Although size of the planet is interesting, I wanted to seee how many people live on each planet. The Death Star may not care about the size, rather the population. I created a scatterplot to see how the size of the planet compares to its population

![Figure](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/popVdiam.png)

The correlation coefficent of the diameter and population of a planet is 0.33 and has a R-squared value of 0.11. This tells us that the relationship between the two variables are quite weak. You can seee that most of the populations are low amongst the averaged sized planets. There are certain planets like Coruscant that has a population of 1 trillion inhabitants but an average diameter of just over 12,000 km. This is insufficent evidence to say that the size of a planet will have an effect on its population.
