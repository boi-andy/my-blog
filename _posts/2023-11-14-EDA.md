As stated in my blog post [Data Collection for Star Wars](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/2023/11/10/data-collection.html), I wanted to learn more about the planets of the Star Wars universe and the inhabitants that live on the planets.

This EDA will give more information on the following questions:

1. What causes a planet in the Star Wars' Galaxy to have a large population?
2. How do the sizes of the planets compare?
3. What does the distrubution of planet size look like?
4. Does the diameter of a planet correlate to the population of the planet?
5. How does Gender effect height in the galaxy?


## Comparison of Planet Size

Each planet has a different size diameter. Here we see a simple bar chart of the diameter of each planet in kilometers. Let's make this a little more interesting by making them circles with color.

This image compares the diameter size of each planet in kilometers. Bespin is the only gas planet, making it the largest planet by far. Other planets like Endor and Mustafar are amongst the smallest planets. 


## Distribution of Planet Diameters

# Basic Statistics for Diameter: <br>
count:        38.00 <br>
mean:      14344.39 <br>
std:       17574.59<br>
min:        4200.00<br>
25%:       10096.00<br>
50%:       12135.00<br>
75%:       13497.50<br>
max:      118000.000<br>

Bespin, the largest planet is skewing the data dramatically, increaing the mean. Let's run another analysis without the outlier.


## Distribution of Planet Diameters (Excluding Outlier)

![Figure](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/distributionExclude.png)

# Basic Statistics for Diameter (Excluding Outlier): <br>
count:       37.00<br>
mean:     11542.89<br>
std:       3304.76<br>
min:       4200.00<br>
25%:      10088.00<br>
50%:      12120.00<br>
75%:      13490.00<br>
max:      19720.00<br>

Without the planet Bespin, the distribution of the planets are much more normal. The standard deviation decresed almost 14,000 km and the mean decreased more than 3,000 km. We can seee that the average planet is about 11,500 km in diameter. The Death Star is able to destroy Alderan which is 12,500 km, meaning many of the planets in the Star Wars galaxy are in great danger so long as the Death Star is functional. 


## Population vs Diameter

Although size of the planet is interesting, I wanted to seee how many people live on each planet. The Death Star may not care about the size, rather the population. I created a scatterplot to see how the size of the planet compares to its population

![Figure](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/popVdiam.png)

The correlation coefficent of the diameter and population of a planet is 0.33 and has a R-squared value of 0.11. This tells us that the relationship between the two variables are quite weak. You can seee that most of the populations are low amongst the averaged sized planets. There are certain planets like Coruscant that has a population of 1 trillion inhabitants but an average diameter of just over 12,000 km. This is insufficent evidence to say that the size of a planet will have an effect on its population.


## Gendeer Boxplot

I was then interested in the people on each planet. I made a [Streamlit app](https://starwarsplanets.streamlit.app/) that shows each character from each planet. Of those people, you can see their characteristics like weight, height, skin color, and gender. I wanted to see if the galaxy was like ours, with men being taller in most cases. I made a boxplot showing the height of each gender to see if this was true.

![Figure](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/genderBox.png)

As I thought, males tend to be taller than females with a median height of about 180 cm. Females have a median height of about 160 cm. As Star Wars takes place in a glaxy far, far away, there are many species that are not male or female. I listed these species as unidentified. The species that did not have specific genders had a median height of just over 100 cm. This is much shorter than males and females. I assumed that these are small creatures found across the galaxy.

## Gender vs Height 

Lastly I wanted to see how heights and weights compared. I wanted to know if the two variables were correlated. 

![Figure](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/heightVmass.png)

After creating a scatterplot, we can see that the weight and height are correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.76 and a R-squared value of 0.58 with a confidence level of 95%. The weight and height of characters in the Star Wars universe have a somewhat strong relationship.

After creating a scatterplot, it looks like the weight and height of Star Wars characters are related. The numbers back it up too - there's a solid connection with a correlation of 0.76 and an R-squared value of 0.58. We're pretty confident about this, like 95% confident. As you can see, the weight and height go hand in hand for Star Wars characters.
